#1. Merging data
Merging datasets from "test" and "train" dataset, with each observation labeled by "subject label(subject_train.txt & subject_test.txt)" and "activity label(y_test.txt & y_train.txt)"

Remove the temporary files after getting the dataframe we need.

---

#2. Rename column name with "features.txt"
Rename the colume name of the dataframe with variables from "features.txt"

---

#3. Extract measurements on the mean and SD
Filter variables containing "mean" and "std".
Rename the subject and activity label

---

#4. label the activity
Change the activity label from numbers to the descriptive string.

---

#5. Rename the colnames
Rename the variables into a more descriptive names.

---

#6. Sum the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
Sum up the dataframe grouped by the 2 labels(subject and activity) and get the mean of each variables.
