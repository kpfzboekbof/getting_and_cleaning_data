*Labels
subject: the ID of the tested or trained subject(participant)
activity: the six acitvities performed in the test or train, which are LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING and WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS.


*Measurements
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 

/time./
These time domain signals (time.) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 

/freq./
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals. 

/Acc/
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

/Jerk/
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals.

/Mag/
The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm.

/.XYZ/
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'.XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
